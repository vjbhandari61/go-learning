🐹 Go in 7 Segments – My Learning Journey

This repo documents my 7-part crash course in Go (Golang).
I already have a background in Node.js, and here I’m diving into Go’s unique strengths — especially concurrency with goroutines and channels.

📚 Learning Segments
✅ Segment 1 – Go Foundations & Environment Setup

Installed Go + set up module system (go mod init).

Wrote my first Hello World in Go.

Learned about variables, constants, and types (var, const, :=).

Functions with single & multiple return values.

Control flow: if, for, switch.

Built a CLI Greeting App using bufio + os.Stdin.

📂 Code is already live at: https://github.com/vjbhandari61/go-learning

⏳ Segment 2 – Data Structures & Error Handling (coming up)

Arrays, slices, maps.

Structs for custom data types.

Pointers & why Go uses them.

Error handling with error type.

Mini-project: Contact Book CLI.

⏳ Segment 3 – Functions, Interfaces, Packages

Functions & multiple return values.

Methods vs functions.

Interfaces for polymorphism.

Writing & importing custom packages.

Mini-project: Math Utility + Shape Areas.

⏳ Segment 4 – Concurrency with Goroutines

Goroutines vs Node.js async.

go keyword for lightweight threads.

Timeouts & time.Sleep.

Mini-project: Concurrent Web Scraper.

⏳ Segment 5 – Channels & Synchronization

Unbuffered vs buffered channels.

select for multiplexing.

Closing channels & detecting completion.

Mini-project: Concurrent Scraper w/ Progress Reporter.

⏳ Segment 6 – REST API in Go

HTTP server with net/http.

Routing, JSON encoding/decoding.

Middleware-like handlers.

Mini-project: Task Manager API.

⏳ Segment 7 – Advanced Project + Wrap-Up

Context & cancellations.

Testing in Go.

Go routines + channels in real-world project.

Capstone: Concurrent Worker Pool with REST interface.

🎯 Goals

Master Go basics in 7 focused segments.

Build 4+ mini-projects + 1 capstone project.

Learn how to use goroutines and channels effectively.

Be ready to build production-style Go services.

📌 Notes

This repo is my personal learning log.
Each segment has its own folder with code & notes.
